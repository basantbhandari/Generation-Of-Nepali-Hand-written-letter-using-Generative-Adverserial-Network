# Nepali Handwritten letter Generation using Generative Adversarial Network
The generative adversarial networks seem to work very effectively for training generative deep neural networks. Our proposed generative adversarial model that works on 36 class, each having 10,000 images, generate the Nepali Handwritten Letters that are similar to the real-life data-set of size 360,000 images. This research paper shows how a generative adversarial framework is used to tell the computer to generate Nepali Handwritten Letter. Our objective is to synthesis of Nepali Handwritten Letter using a learning framework called generative adversarial networks. We construct discriminator networks and generator networks both of five
convolution layers and choose the activation function such that generator networks generate the image and discriminator networks check the generated image is how similar to real-life image. To measure the quantitative performance, we use the Frechet inception distance (FID) methodology. The FID value we find of 18 random samples, generated by our networks is 38413677.145. For a qualitative measure of our model let the reader judge the quality of the image generated by our generator model.
